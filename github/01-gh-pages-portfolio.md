# GH-Pages portfolio
Github Pages allows you to host static sites directly from your GitHub account:  
You can have one site for your entire profile - http://elium-student.github.io/.  
Each repository can also have a static site associated with it - https://elium-student.github.io/my-first-repo/, https://elium-student.github.io/perfect-repo/.  

We will be using gh-pages to turn your GitHub accounts into a one-stop-shop showcase of your skills.  Like in the elium-student account above, you will host a live CV on your profile's gh-page.  From the CV you will link to both the source code and live demos of your current best projects.  

GitHub is a powerful and flexible resource.  Turning our profiles into a CV and portfolio is the first step in our exploration of GitHub's built-in features.
