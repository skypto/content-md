## Gists, Pull Requests,  & Issues

We will be doing almost everything on GitHub.  GitHub comes with many great tools for collaboration.  These are the elementals.
___
### Gists
These are designed for sharing code snippets.  You can send them as a link, edit them, fork them, and they stay connected to your GitHub account so you can always find them back. They're ideal for asking questions over slack, copy-pasting error messages and notes on solving them, sharing solutions, or sharing neat tricks.  Simple to use but crucial.

### Pull Requests
These are used for contributing to other people's GitHub repositories.  You will be using pull requests to improve your content over the next 3 months.  If you're reading a lesson and would like suggest better wording, new resources, extra exercises, ...  send us a pull request!  You'll be getting practice collaborating and improving your classmate's study materials at the same time.

### Issues
These are part of the GitHub workflow. Issues are connected to a specific repository.  You can use them as a todo list, to assign tasks to team members, or as notes for yourself.  Using these effectively can be tricky, it requires organization and planning.
