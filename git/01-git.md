# GIT Basics
___
Git can feel cumbersome and unintuitive at the start, don't not worry about understanding everything about git right away. You get more comfortable with it as you use it - git is a passive skill that will improve over time with use and understanding the basics is enough for now. We will introduce the more advanced features as you need them for group collaboration.
