# Navigating Codebase

In you developer life you'll use more of other people's code than your own.  Your ability to choose and compare open source libraries will be crucial.  This isn't easy.  You need to balance features, community, documentation, opinion, ... the list goes on.  All that will come with experience.

Before any other skills, you need to know how to navigate codebase.  Documentation is good, wikis are nice, communities are helpful, but they are all built to support a living codebase.  Eight hours into a bug there will be no more helpful documentation or Q/A's that you haven't read, your only hope will to be going into a library's GitHub repo and sifting through the codebase my hand. 

At times like these, familiarity with reading through large projects will save your sanity.  Firstly because you've (hopefully) chosen a clearly written library, and secondly because you'll finally fix that darned bug!

### Why to read the source

* It's the only way to know what's really going on. [1](https://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/). [2](http://wiki.c2.com/?UseTheSourceLuke).
* [To choose libraries](http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/jan/22/choosing-javascript-library/)

### What to read

Some good libraries to start with:
* [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash), my recommendation.  It's very well done and you'll need to learn it evetually anyway.
* [Hashnode recommendations](https://hashnode.com/post/suggest-simple-libraries-to-read-source-code-for-learning-js-ciibz8fji01c7j3xte6q5dmz5)

### Counterpoint

[CodingHorror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/when-understanding-means-rewriting/).  From a certain perspective the source code is irrelevant.
It's main point is that apps aren't about code, they're about user experinces.  It say the best way to understand an app or library is to understand the user experiences and replicate them.
