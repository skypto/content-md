Morgan
===

Morgan is a HTTP request logger middleware for node.js. It handles automated logging of requests, responses and related data. When added as a middleware to an express app, by default it should log statements to console showing details of: remote ip, request method, http version, response status, user agent etc. It allows you to modify the log using tokens or add color to them by defining 'dev' or even logging out to an output stream, like a file.
