  + if you're using something else and you're comfortable with it, no problem

> Not-so-optionally there's a nice, litte package called Prettier that autoformats your code so that it looks, well, prettier. Look it up [here](https://github.com/prettier/prettier "Prettier").
> Scroll all the way down for how to integrate it with your code editor of choice.  If you don't want to integrate prettier, we still recommend you prettier your code from the command line before pushing it.

+ [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/ "NodeJS") (Just install Node, NPM is installed with it).

+ [Chrome Web Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html "Chrome") (if not yet installed) 

+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Only if you're on a Windows. Should already be installed on Mac/Linux)

All downloaded? Great! You now have one badass development environment!

##### WORTH CONSIDERING
Everyone should give this a shot, but it will be especially helpful if you're a window's user.  Try using linux.  
Dual-booting from a flash-drive is a low-stakes way of getting your hands dirty.
