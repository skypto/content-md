# Functional Programming

```
OOP = Data bundled with functionality.
    + Objects are the building blocks of your program
    + Objects have methods to act on their data
FP = functionality bundled with data
    + Functions are the building blocks of your program
    + Functions have closures to remember values
```

The lines between these are blurred in JS, good javascripting requires and knowing both and choosing the right approach to each problem.  OOP is more intuitive than FP, nearly everything we've done so far has benn OOP.  

The best way to wrap your head around FP is to do it.  Below is a list of resources and exercises on FP.  We will complete and discuss some of these toghether, your choice which ones.
