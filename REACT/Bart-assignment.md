Bart has two assignments to prepare for his first day of REACT next Monday:  
1. [REACT's own tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)  
2. [Scotch's tutorial](https://scotch.io/courses/getting-started-with-react)  
  
He plans on covering the practical points of using REACT that are not well covered in any tutorial.  Preparing on the basics from these two resources will prepare you for what he plans on covering.
