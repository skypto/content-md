forming and maintinging good group dynamics
   


conceptual integrity in a software prouct
 


product lifecycle



    
Each group should have completed:
    1: complete project outline - you could hand it off and another team could create an app that does the same thing as yours
    2: dev plan/schedule - you could hand it off and another team could build your app the way you have it in mind
    3: first draft deployed - an mvp good enough for a pitch
    4: second draft deployed - an mvp good enough to convince a good developer to work on your code
    5: public face - enough for anyone to find you project an know what you're about
