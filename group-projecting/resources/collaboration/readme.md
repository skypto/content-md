### AGILE

This is the principle paradigm in small-medium companies and startups.  It's what we'll be practicing this week.

## roles

Splitting responsibilites between team members can be done many ways.  Each team will do things slightly differently depending on their skills, project, and management.  Despite what you might read elsewhere, there is no single best way to organize a team.

Across all philosophies is one uniting thread:
    Team roles are created to represent important pieces of a project.
    When taking on a role, that piece becomes your responsibility:
        when planning, you take that perspective's side
        when making decisions, you speak from that perspective

### AUDIENCES

A finished project has 3 main audiences: Users, Developers, Computers.

When debating a design decision it helps to designate 3 temporary roles. Someone to consider the decision ...
  * as a user
  * as a futur developer
  * as a computer

It can also help to assign one person to speak for the development process.  ie. will this new feature add a week to deployment? should we worry about this later so we don't kill each other now?

### SCRUM

Scrum is one method of keeping a team on track and facilitating communication.  It fits nicely with Agile philosophies

[scrum method](http://www.scrum-institute.org/Scrum_Roles_The_Scrum_Team.php)


 
roles - everyone develops, everyone write and push their own tests, everyone user tests
* project manager - scope of project, user focus, schedule, deadline
* architect - technical reference point
* testers - between pilot and real deal, a full series of user tests and real tests are implemented.
* tool maker?  
role playing  
* defender of the user  
* defender of the computer  
* defender of the developer  
* defender of the development


 group roles
        think of them as having eachothers back: each person's assigned role is their promise they'll take care of that for you
    group stages
    communication
    conflict resolution
