### Team Roles

There are many ideas on the roles in a development team.  Here are listed 3 different ways of dividing responsibility between members in a group.  Keep in mind that these roles have nothing to do with writing code, no matter what your role you still write code and the code you write doesn't have to be related to the group role you play.

This is the procedure you will follow as a group durring group project week. Familiarize yourselves with it now:


* prepare your workspace - empty repos, roles, ...
* define the scope of our project, come up with user stories
* create a 'dependency tree' of stories
* select an order for features based on the tree  
* decide on an architecture:  
  * mvc? apps/components? microservices? spa? ssr?  
  * choose the one that makes most sense for your product, development, and maintenance. 
  * if done well, a user shouldn't know the difference (unless it's slow or crashes)  
* decide the tools and libraries.  react? passport strategies? build tools?
* plan specs for each feature (and tests depending on strategy)
  * this is your backlog
* prepare mockups  
* __while feature in backlog__  
  * write tests (if you haven't yet)  
  * test your code
  * push your code
  * assemble and test the feature
  * reflect
  * plan how this could be done better next feature
  * document - hopefully autmatically
  * coffee break
* complete testing
* complete demo (if appropriate)
* complete documentation
* complete repository
* complete landing page
