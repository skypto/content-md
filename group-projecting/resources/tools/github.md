### Gists
These are designed for sharing code snippets.  You can send them as a link, edit them, fork them, and they stay connected to your GitHub account so you can always find them back. They're ideal for asking questions over slack, copy-pasting error messages and notes on solving them, sharing solutions, or sharing neat tricks.  Simple to use but crucial.

### Pull Requests
These are used for contributing to other people's GitHub repositories.  You will be using pull requests to improve your content over the next 3 months.  If you're reading a lesson and would like suggest better wording, new resources, extra exercises, ...  send us a pull request!  You'll be getting practice collaborating and improving your classmate's study materials at the same time.

### Issues
These are part of the GitHub workflow. Issues are connected to a specific repository.  You can use them as a todo list, to assign tasks to team members, or as notes for yourself.  Using these effectively can be tricky, it requires organization and planning.

### Repos

Finished code isn't a finished project.  Navigable and helpful GitHub repositories are finished projects. Fortunately git provides all the tools necessary to organize your code in a developer-friendly way and GitHub provides a great interface for exploring well-organized projects.

Building a good repo is a little tricky and will take some practice.  It requires careful planning and extra attention through your development process.

### What makes a good repo?

You will begin implementing these features in week 1 project:
* [An informative README](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
* [Version tags](http://semver.org) - versions are fully functional releases, they can be downloaded and run without crashing.
* Branches - gh-pages branch, master release branch. 
* gh-pages demo, or link to live-hosted demo
* tests - for now, simple hand-build testing suites

Later in the course we will discuss how to use these features in a repo:
* documentation - wiki, gh-pages, markdown.  There are many ways to do this
* Full testing suites
* Contributing guidelines - ideas for contributors, code of conduct, ...
* Github projects - for organizing collaborative directly in the repo
* Pull requests and issues

This lesson is the first in a series of lessons that will cover how to use GitHub to organize your entire development process.  This series will include lessons on Agile and Scrum methodologies by Juan David and will culminate in the final colaborative projects in the last 4 weeks of this program.
